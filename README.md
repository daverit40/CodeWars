# CodeWars
All of my CodeWars Modules

I've been participating in an online coding community called codewars.com. This repository is intended to expose my work as I solve problems and rank up over time.

The majority of the work is in the codewars.js and codewars.cs files. I began my journey on codewars primarily doing c# modules, however, after a few months I turned my attention to coding in javascript as I am trying to learn more in that language. 

Don't be thrown if you try to use the webform1.aspx file in your browser, I merely used that to make testing easier when I needed to. The primary functionality rests within the .js and .cs files respectively. 

In most cases, each individual function addresses a specific task or challenge that was presented on codewars. On occasion, multiple functions will work together to solve a problem. 

In the future I will go back and add comments inside of each function describing the challenge as it was presented to me on codewars.
